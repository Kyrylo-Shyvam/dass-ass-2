# Problems

## Implementation problems (logic is wrong/inefficient, bugs in gameplay)
* The king has no fixed shapes. Probably some problem in rendering.
* King is stuck when he reaches borders of wall.
* Healing does not work. Game crashes.
* Healing should "heal" troops not buildings.
* Health bar is not always visible.

## Problems in OOPs style (code duplication, no use of classes, etc)
* In class of barbarian king, there is lots of code duplication. 
There is separate check for all 4 directions, and each has different check for all 4 types of buildings.

* Are both 'idArray' and 'colorArray' required in gameclass.py ?
